# Question Answering App with LangChain, FastAPI, and Streamlit

This project is a **starter template** to help you learn how to work with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). It provides a simple but complete pipeline from API to UI:

- **LangChain** to interact with OpenAI's GPT models  
- **FastAPI** backend to serve predictions  
- **Streamlit** frontend for a user-friendly interface  
- **Docker** for easy deployment  

---

## Features

- Ask any general or technical question via the UI  
- LLMs process your question with LangChain  
- Reusable and extensible FastAPI endpoint  
- Optional: Docker support for containerized deployment
